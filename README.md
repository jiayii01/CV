# Emotion and Gender Classification Computer Vision Project 

## 👷🏻‍♀️ Why did I build this?
Exploring something new and exposing myself to the domain of Computer Vision! Utilised keras (VGG16), OpenCV (Caffe) and Streamlit. 
Streamlit site ran locally and models are not uploaded as it was too big 

## 💻 User Interface built using Streamlit
